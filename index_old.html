                    <h1>Strong Starts</h1>A lone soul who started at the peak of purity. One that could be seen as a
                    beacon of light. Among him were his peers, they were mostly satisfied with the life they were born
                    into. But, for a being like himself, there was always a chip on his shoulder, there was always a
                    reason for him to find the flaws in the reality in which he was born. His story started
                    prosperously, god-like powers, immortality, and duties he was expected to follow. This part of his
                    life was all too normal, it passed and he observed the people he was meant to, while also
                    maintaining a small sub-section of a quadrant, as it was his job. Maintaining something wasn’t all
                    that hard in his mind, it was simple to manipulate variables present to get the results that he
                    wanted, and while interference with the mortal world was prohibited, he knew that the true way of
                    ‘maintaining’ mortals was to guide them along a path, may it be planned or not, this was the only
                    true way. Nevertheless, his mentality about mortals was never utilized, he never went about putting
                    his hand where it did not belong, he played his role and continued on with his life. Noting down
                    progress, keeping track of certain events, handling the probability to destruction, the potential of
                    dangerous events and general tasks done with his position as an assistant. With time and effort, he
                    rose up from a mere assistant to the overseer of his own quadrants, north and south respectively.

                    <h1>Descent</h1>While new found power is typically respected and taken in kind, something about the
                    potential of his power started to corrupt the Shinjin. His mentality was something fragile at this
                    point, he wore a mask at all times, certain to not raise any flags amongst his fellow Shinjin. He
                    watched over the quadrants as he was supposed to, but like a moth to flame, he couldn’t help
                    himself. With such obscene power his hand reached for the minds of mortals. He spoke to those who
                    believed in gods and led them down the paths of crusaders, he sparked the minds of rebels into
                    coups, he led Kings to their downfall and he communed with the vilest of people. While depraved
                    acts, spawned from the corruption of authority, any of his peers would have at least hoped he did it
                    in the name of a greater good, for at least that goal can be seen as a good one. That was never the
                    case for him, however, his acts were simply on a whim, his mind was long gone to the life of living
                    normally and peacefully, for inside the mind of whatever that is alive there is a balance. Too much
                    order and the side of chaos wants to be unleashed. He was too suched into order, his entire life
                    revolved around order, it revolved around maintaining order as well and as he opened his eyes to the
                    mortal world, he awakened. A world filled with chaos, unpredictable actions guided by the whimsical
                    nature of mortals, it was something he’d be willing to give it all up for. With his acts all done
                    and his trail likely not that hidden he quickly fled with the excuse of using his sabbatical.
                    A diabolical plan, one that would allow him to further express himself as he wants and that was of
                    course by becoming human.

                    <h1>Aftermath</h1>After reaching Autabil he donned a new look, a new name and most importantly: a
                    new personality. He had to adapt on the fly, for his biggest thrill would be living among the
                    mortals, not proudly displaying what he was for all to see. He had to be efficient in this act, he
                    had to have reasons for why he did things and a reliable story, he had to seem like he ‘fit’ in the
                    piece of the pie that was this galaxy.
                    <br>
                    <p>To start with he named himself ‘Knox ‘Rick’ Fukuda-Dominguez‘
                        and then furthermore went and started his story, like a short story author starting a rough
                        draft.
                        He was from a corner of Motora… from a small town too! And he was alone because… ten years ago
                        his
                        father died on a work trip to Verole City! His mother died three years after this from some
                        unknown
                        illness that he couldn’t help her with. And.. And, during his youth, he was bullied for having
                        lanky
                        legs! All the kids made fun of him and made him self-conscious, he’s never had a girlfriend
                        before
                        because after school he got caught up in working to support his family! Yes, yes, he was onto
                        something here. After working, studying and finally having what it takes to be a detective he
                        started working shortly after both his mother and father died. For the most part he was
                        small-time,
                        but after doing enough jobs and being able to move to the City he quickly went, and that is why
                        he
                        is here now. After getting to the city he signed up for the VPD, then he moved on to become a
                        detective.
                        From here he does odd jobs, working as a personal detective when he can, and doing his own job
                        when he can. His over arching goal?
                        Well of course it is to find out what happened to his father! And then figure out what happened
                        to his mother! After that? He'll wing it.</p>
                    Content with the contents of the story that were manifested, the Human now known as Knox or Rick was
                    created.
                    He donned a suit, and furthermore he fitted himself a pitch-black mask on his face to obscure
                    anybody froms seeing him.
                    This one, was an ironic symbol to him, for all the times he had a mask on in his life, it was funny
                    that even while expressing himself, he'd be wearing another.
                    Now, with the first details out of the way, the fallen Shinjin sought to complete his first goal:
                    enter into the crime underground.

                    <h1>OOC Notes/Goals</h1>Key:Gogeto25<br>
                    Character:Knox 'Rick' Fukuda-Dominguez<br>
                    Race:Shinjin<br>
                    Goals(Reasoning): 
                        <li>Cause Chaos</li>
                        <li>Play both sides, using one another to further the beef between one another.</li>
                        <li>Lead people into questionable situations. Knox exists to fuck up the balance of the world and universe as a whole, despite his role.
                            Given his corruption and nature, he looks to find people seeking power, fame, fortune and turn their desires against them.
                        </li>
                        <li>Reach the state of Maikaio</li>
                        <li>Experience what it is like to be human/mortal. At the end of the day Knox desires what humans have, the chaotic, whmisical, flimsy nature they posses.
                            Coming from his nature of order, he desires chaos, it has broken down his mind and as such, he's trying to become what he appears to be.
                        </li>
                        <li>As for long term goals, I'm aiming to guide either side and play the role of a Shinjin, albeit from the shadows. I'm seeing to fight though as well</li>
                        <li>I'd PREFER to remain as hidden as I can (my race that is) so people aren't aware of what he is. Still, it is probably bound to get exposed somehow.</li>
                        <li>MAKE STORY MAKE STORY. I will be trying to be both a detective and part of the criminal underground while also being Shinjin. </li>
