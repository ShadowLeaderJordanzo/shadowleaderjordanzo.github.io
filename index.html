                        <h1>Obey At Any Cost?</h1>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Imagine being hired to be a teacher's assistant for a day at a prestigious college, or a place where very important test are had.
                                For whatever reason, you are motivated to get this job done. May it be the prospect of being paid well, an internship or because you are a kind person. 
                                When the test start you can tell that the students are struggling from their mannerisms. It is obvious due to their vocalizations and body language that they are getting questions wrong.
                                As time passes, the stress cumiliates and the students -- out of frustration -- try to ask questions. Despite this, the teacher is very sten and never gives them an answer.
                                When a student accuses the teacher of putting questions that weren't in the class, and he doesn't know what to do, the teacher reassures that all the content was either gone over in class, or by the textbook.
                                The student starts to cry, the teacher tells them to stop crying and to get back to doing their work.  </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>
                                After the students finish their tests the teacher hands you the correct answer sheet and goes back to preparing for the next class.
                                You are left with believing either the student or the teacher, and you get to work on filling out tests.
                                You notice that the student who was crying got the most answers wrong, and their classmates are in the same boat. 
                                With a lot of the tests out of the way you can conclude this was hard and knowing what you do, some of this content wasn't covered in class.
                                The students remain and collect every test you finish from you and you have to watch them leave with tears on their face.
                                If you are hesistant the teacher reassures you must grade accordingly, regardless of their emotional state.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> Now, after two thirds of the students are graded, you can say wth confidence that the majority failed and will get denied whatever they were testing for.
                                With each and every student that comes up now, you can tell they are destroyed semotionally and whatever test this was for will have lasting impacts on their future.
                                <br>
                                Despite this, you have to grade them accordingly and you can't help but feel like you are a part of the problem.
                                <br>
                                Or, you try to tell the teacher that the test is unfair, and thet students should get a second chance.
                                <br>
                                He tells you to grade the test, and they will not get a second chance, and no matter what you do it is of the upmost importance you grade the test accordingly. 
                                The teacher responds the same way even if you ask again.

                        <h1>Stanley Milgram</h1>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Stanley Milgram was a Jewish born Psychologist from the Bronx, New York. He was noted as one of the most important social psychologists of the 20th century. He was known for his experiments on obedience and authority.
                                He was born in 1933 and died in 1984. <br>
                                Milgram's most famous experiment was the Obedience Experiment, an experiment designed to study the obedience of people to authority figures.
                                Milgram had devised his study to try and explain the psychology of genocide, and how people could be so easily persuaded to commit atrocities.
                                <br>In his own words: "Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices?" <br>
                                The results of the experiment were shocking, and showed that people were willing to obey authority figures even when they were told to commit acts that they knew were wrong.
                                The original researchers estimated a fraction of a tenth of a percent of participants would disobey the experimenter, but in reality, 65% of participants obeyed the experimenter and continued to administer shocks to the learner.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Miligram faced harsh critizism about how ethical his experiment was after it was published.
                                These ethical concerns were because of the deception used, the lack of protection of the participants and the fact that the right to withdraw was seemingly ignored.<br> Due to the controversy surrounding him his contract at Yale was only extended for a year, but he was also made a lecturer when before he was an assistant professor.
                                Despite the bad publicity, Milgram's study is still considered one of the most important experiments in psychology. He also went on to publish many other studies, including the famous "Small World Experiment" which showed that the average number of connections between two people is 6.

                        <h1>The Milgram Experiment</h1>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> Similar to the fake experiment made up in an earlier slide, this involves a teacher and a student.
                                The Milgram Experiment involved a teacher and a learner who were both assumed to be coming to the lab for a psychology experiment.
                                One of these people was an actor, and the other was a real participant, the Experiment was also rigged so that the actor would always be the learner.
                                There was also an Experimenter who was also an actor, and was in charge of the experiment.
                                The Experimenter would tell the teacher that the learner was in the next room, and that they were going to be administering shocks to the learner and that the research was about the effects of punishment on learning.
                                If the learner was wrong, the teacher would have to admister increasing levels of shock to the learner; the learner who was an actor would always be wrong and would always cry out in pain.
                                As the shocks got increasingly more painful, the learner would beg the teacher to stop, but the teacher would be told by the experimenter that it must continue until the learner got the answer right.
                                When asked if the shocks would leave any damage, the Experimenter would assure them that the shocks were completely safe, just temporary discomfort.
                                Once the voltage got to around the 300 volt level, the learner would stop responding, and the teacher would be told to continue if they didn't answer after a certain time. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> The predictions of the number of teachers would would do the maximum voltage was a range of 0-3 out of 100, for an average of 1.2 out of 100.
                                This poll was given to both colleagues and senior-year psychology students; both groups predicted roughly the same number.
                                The actual results were astonishing with 65% of participants administering the maximum voltage despite the screams of the learner.
                                Participants displayed signs of stress like sweating, trembling, nervous laughing, stuttering and even serizures. 
                                When replicated across the world, the results stayed nearly the same, and there was even an experiment done where the researchers were in an unmarked, poorly maintained office.
                                These results were somewhat lowered, but still stayed close to the original results.
