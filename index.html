                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Imagine being hired to be a teacher's assistant for a day at a prestigious college, or a place where very important test are had.
                                Imagine they pay you handsomly for your work done for the day, and so long as you get all of the tests graded and returned to the students, you will be paid.
                                <s>Now imagine that the teacher tells you that you must give the students a shock if they get a question wrong, and that the shock will increase in intensity with each wrong answer.</s>
                            In this hypothetical, let's say you witness these students taking the test and you can tell that they're struggling.
                                You can tell that they're getting the questions wrong, and you can tell that they're getting more and more stressed as the test goes on.
                                When they try and questions the teacher, he's very stern and doesn't give them any answers.
                                At one point during the exam, one of the students starts to cry, and claims the teacher didn't go over this in class and that he doesn't know what to do.
                                The teacher assures them all of the material was either gone over in class or in the textbook, and that they should just keep trying.

                        </div>

                            <p>After you wait for the students to finish their test the teacher hands you the answer sheet and goes back to the work he was doing.
                                You can tell that a lot of the students got the questions wrong, and that they're all very stressed out.
                                After grading a few of the test you can tell that this material was hard, and that some of it may not have got covered in this specific class.
                                With every test you finish grading a student comes to collect, after your third graded test you notice that the student is crying.
                                The teacher tells you that you must grade accordingly, and that they should have all been prepared for the test.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> After you do a few more test you can confidently say that a good majority of these students have failed, and will be denied whatever they are going for because of this test.
                                With every student that comes up to you, you can tell their emotional state is getting worse and worse. Some cry, others yell, and some just look defeated.
                                You try to tell the teacher that you think the test was unfair, and that the students should be given a second chance.
                                The teacher tells you that you must grade the test as is, and that you must mark the student's questions down as wrong if they are wrong.
                                You continue to grade the test, more students fail, and more students are denied what they are going for.
                                Everytime you try to tell the teacher that you think the test was unfair, he tells you the same thing, that you must grade the test as is.

                        <h1>Stanley Milgram</h1>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Stanley Milgram was a Jewish born Psychologist from the Bronx, New York. He was noted as one of the most important social psychologists of the 20th century. He was known for his experiments on obedience and authority.
                                He was born in 1933 and died in 1984. <br>
                                Milgram's most famous experiment was the Obedience Experiment, an experiment designed to study the obedience of people to authority figures.
                                Milgram had devised his study to try and explain the psychology of genocide, and how people could be so easily persuaded to commit atrocities.
                                <br>In his own words: "Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all accomplices" <br>
                                The results of the experiment were shocking, and showed that people were willing to obey authority figures even when they were told to commit acts that they knew were wrong.
                                The original researchers estimated a fraction of a tenth of a percent of participants would disobey the experimenter, but in reality, 65% of participants obeyed the experimenter and continued to administer shocks to the learner.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p>Miligram faced harsh critizism about how ethical his experiment was after it was published. Due to the controversy surrounding him his contract at Yale was only extended for a year, but he was also made a lecturer when before he was an assistant professor.
                                Despite the bad publicity, Milgram's study is still considered one of the most important experiments in psychology. He also went on to publish many other studies, including the famous "Small World Experiment" which showed that the average number of connections between two people is 6.

                        <h1>The Milgram Experiment</h1>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> Similar to the fake experiment made up in an earlier slide, this involves a teacher and a student.
                                The Milgram Experiment involved a teacher and a learner who were both assumed to be coming to the lab for a psychology experiment.
                                One of these people was an actor, and the other was a real participant, the Experiment was also rigged so that the actor would always be the learner.
                                There was also an Experimenter who was also an actor, and was in charge of the experiment.
                                The Experimenter would tell the teacher that the learner was in the next room, and that they were going to be administering shocks to the learner and that the research was about the effects of punishment on learning.
                                If the learner was wrong, the teacher would have to admister increasing levels of shock to the learner; the learner who was an actor would always be wrong and would always cry out in pain.
                                As the shocks got increasingly more painful, the learner would beg the teacher to stop, but the teacher would be told by the experimenter that it must continue until the learner got the answer right.
                                When asked if the shocks would leave any damage, the Experimenter would assure them that the shocks were completely safe, just temporary discomfort.
                                Once the voltage got to around the 400 volt level, the learner would stop responding, and the teacher would be told to continue if they didn't answer after a certain time. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="information">
                            <p> The predictions of the number of teachers would would do the maximum voltage was a range of 0-3 out of 100, for an average of 1.2 out of 100.
                                This poll was given to both collkeagues and senior-year psychology students; both groups predicted roughly the same number.
                                The actual results were astonishing with 65% of participants administering the maximum voltage despite the screams of the learner.
                                Participants displayed signs of stress like sweating, trembling, nervous laughing, stuttering and even serizures. 
                                When replicated across the world, the results stayed nearly the same, and there was even an experiment done where the researchers were in an unmarked, poorly maintained office.
                                These results were somewhat lowered, but still stayed close to the original results.
